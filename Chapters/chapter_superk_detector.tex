\section{The Super-Kamiokande detector}

\subsection{Background and detector design}

Super-Kamiokande is a neutrino observatory consisting of a cyclindrical tank which is 41.4 m in height and 39.3 m in diamter, and filled with 50kton of ultrapure water and gadolinium sulphate. It is used as a neutrino detctor for atmospheric, solar and astrophysical neutrinos, as well as being a far detector of the Tokai-to-Kamioka neutrino beam. It is based in the Mozumi mine, located in Gifu Prefecture, Japan. Due to it's location being underneath Mount Ikenoyama, 1000m underground, it is shielded as much as possible from the cosmic ray muon detector background. Super-Kamiokande is divided into two concentric cylinder volumes, consisting of the inner detector (ID) and outer detector (OD) using a stainless steel structure which supports the photomultiplier tubes. Tyvek and black polyethylene terephthelate sheets are mounted on this structure in order to optically seperate the inner and outer detector \cite{suzukiSuperKamiokandeExperiment2019}.

The inner detector is a cylinder which has a diameter of 33.8 m and a height of 36.2m, and has a fiducial volume of 22.5ktons of water. It is host to 11,129 photomultiplier tubes which give 40\% photocoverage of its inner surface, with the specific photomultiplier model chosen being the hemispherical, 50.8 cm diameter Hamamastu R3600 model. The outer detector has only 1885 photomultiplier tubes which are mounted on the outside of stainless steel structure, each with a smaller diameter of 20cm, and are either the R1408 or R5912 Hamamatsu model. Each outer detector photomultiplier tube is attached to a 50cm x 50cm wavelength shifting plate, improving the light collection ability in the OD. 

A detailed schematic of the photomultiplier tubes used in Super-Kamiokande can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:PMTdiagram}. The photocathodes used in these PMTs are comprised of bialkali antimony-potassium-caesium material (Sb-K-Cs), which give a greater sensitivity on to longer wavelengths, giving the greatest spectral response at 360 nm, near the ultraviolet section. This makes these types of photocathodes suitable to use for matching with light sources in the blue region of the visible spectrum, which is the region in which the wavelength of Cherenko photons lie. The 11 dynodes which are inside the photomultiplier tube are arranged in a "venetian blind" fashion, meaning that the dynodes consist of an assembly of parallel strips. This results in a good collection efficiency of the multiplied electrons and gives decent protection from external magentic fields. More protection from external magnetic fields is provided by a set of Helmholtz coils which are aligned around the inner walls of the innter detector, which reduce the ambient background geomagnetic field from 450mG to 50mG. This is needed due to the systematic bias that could occur due to the strength and uniform direction of the geomagnetic field affecting the photon trajectories and consequently the photomultiplier tube hit timing.

Radioactivity from radon, uranium and thorium radioisotopes in the Super-Kamiokande tank water and radon in the surrounding air could provide a low energy background to measurements which should be negated. In low-energy analyses, such as the analysis in this thesis, this becomes an even more significant issue. Microbes present in the mine water also present a problem as they cause a reduction in the value of the light attenuation length by a factor of $e$. Therefore the water used in Super-Kamiokande has to undergo a purification process - the water used is continously reprocessed at a rate of 30 tons $h^-1$ in a closed loop system, which is the same method used to purify the water when refilling the tank. The first step of this water purification process is to use a 1$\micro m$ mesh filter to remove large particulates of impurities from the water. A heat exchanger is then used to cool down the water to a constant 13.0 \degree C to reduce the dark noise hits of the photomultiplier tubes and the growth of the microbes. A treatment with ultraviolet light is then used to kill any remaining microbes in the water. Radon-free air is then dissolved into the water to aid in the later process of radon removal from the water and a high performance membrane ultra filter (UF) is used to remove organic compounds about 10 nm in diamater from the water. After this step a membrane degasifier removes the dissolved radon, where 30 L of radon reduced air is supplied to the membrane degasifier. The dissolved radon will transfer across the membrane but the water will not, allowing for efficient radon reduction. The inner detector tank water is circulated by injecting the water at the bottom of the tank and exctracting it from the top, where the convection currents are able to maintain the temperature in the region within 11m to the bottom of tank, however, outside this region the present temperature gradient causes an asymmetry in the attenuation of light, which is discussed more in Chapter 3.   
\newline
 An air purification system is also installed in Super-Kamiokande in order to reduce the amount of Radon present which could dissolve into the tank and affect measurements. The level of radon activity achieved after this air purification has taken place is 1 $mBq/m^3$.

The Super-Kamiokande experiment began taking data on 1st April 1996, and due to maintenance was shut down in July 2001, which was phase I of the experiment. A table of the Super-Kamiokande phases is shown in Table \ref{table:phasetable}. During the refilling of the tank after maintenence, there was cascade of PMT implosions that occurred on the 12th of November 2001, which were triggered by the implosion of a single photomultiplier tube, due to a microfracture in the neck of the tube. This implosion destroyed about 7,000 of the PMTs and in order to avoid such chain reactions in the future, from 2002 onwards all of the inner detector PMTs were encased inside acrylic and fibreglass shields. The experiment resumed in October 2002, and phase II of Super-Kamiokande began, and by October 2005 the experiement was fully rebuilt and resumed data taking with the full number of photomultiplier tubes in July 2006 which marked the beginning of Super-Kamiokande phase III. Super-Kamiokande phase IV began in September 2008 where a new data aquisition system and charge to time (QTC) based electronics with Ethernet (QBEE) was deployed in order to measure arrival times and integrated charge for inner detector and outer detector photomultiplier tube signals. This replaced the ATM (Analogue and Timing Module) which was used in Phase I, II and III of Super-Kamiokande. The improvements in electronics and calibration methods meant that when Super-Kamiokande phase IV started running in September of 2008, electrons with energies as low as 3.5 MeV were able to be detected.

\subsection{Data aquisition system}

As shown in Table \ref{phasetable}, Phase IV of the experiment marked the beginning of Super-Kamiokande using QTC-based Electronics with Ethernet (QBEEs). Each QBEE board used in Super-Kamiokande contains 24 photomultiplier tube input channel, where each channel uses a charge-to-time (QTC) converter and a time-to-digital converter placed in series as shown in Figure \ref{fig:superkdaq}. After a single photoelectron is produced by the photomultiplier tubes after incident photons have been recieved upon it, the dynodes inside the photomultiplier tube amplify this photoelectron so that each photoelectron that strikes the surface of the dynode produces several more photoelectrons, which is outputted from the the dynodes as an analogue signal. This signal then enters a charge-to-time converter (QTC), an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) which was specifically designed for Super-Kamiokande in order to detect photomultiplier tube signals using built-in discriminators and to produce output timing signals whose widths represent the integrated charge of the PMT signal. The QTC used has three input channels per chip, which has three gain ranges (Small, Medium, Large as shown in Figure \ref{fig:superkdaq}). There is a built in discriminator inside the QTC which determines whether the the signal from a PMT is a "hit". If the PMT signal exceeds the threshold value of this discriminator, the QTC integrates the charge of the signal over the next 400ns, and a square wave pulse is generated whose pulse width is proportional to the intergrated charge of the input signal from the PMT. The next ~400ns is used to discharge the integrated charge from the QTC, leading to a total channel dead time of 900 ns due to summing the charge integration and discharge of the QTC. 
\newline

A time-to-digital converter (TDC) then digitises the output time signal, so the PMT charge information is retained. These digitised outputs are collated by 20 front-end computers which collects all the information from the inner and outer detectors, with each computer taking the PMT hit information from 30 inner detector and 20 outer detector QBEE boards and sorting the PMT hit time information in order of the raw hit time. This information is then sent to "merger" computers, who then produce a full time-ordered list of all PMT hits. These merger computers then apply software triggers to select event candidates, using $N_{200}$, a quantity which determines the number of PMT hits in a 200 ns timing window. When the value of $N_{200}$ surpasses the threshold value of a certain trigger type (whether it is a SLE (Super Low Energy), LE (Low Energy), HE (High Energy), SHE (Super High Energy), OD (Outer Detector) or AFT (After Window) trigger), the trigger is used to select an event candidate. The SLE, LE, HE and SHE triggers roughly define the energy of a certain event, based on the number of hits detected. The OD trigger is used to veto events, and the AFT trigger is of special importance to the analysis in this thesis: it is used to discern when a neutron is produced after a neutrino interaction. Another set of computer acts as an "organiser": it takes all the information regarding the event candidates from the "merger" computers and writes them onto disks. 






\section{Event Reconstruction}

\subsection{Vertex Reconstruction}
For low energy events (events up to 100MeV), Super-Kamiokande currently uses BONSAI (Branch Optimisation Navigating Successive Annealing Interactions) for event reconstruction. Vertex reconstruction for Super-Kamiokande has undergone changes and improvements depending on the phase of the experiment. 
\newline{}
For Phase I of Super-Kamiokande, vertex reconstruction depended on a lattice of test vertices with 4m spacing throughout the detector, with a specific measure of goodness for each test vertex: the test vertex with the highest measure of goodness would have around it a more finely spaced grid, and the process would be repeated. For Phase II of Super-Kamiokande due to the reduced number of PMTs, this approach was no longer as successful as it was in Phase I and as a result the reconstruction perfomance declined, and BONSAI was created as a replacement. Instead of using a fixed grid which was the case with SK-I and SK-II, BONSAI creates test vertices by selecting groups of four PMT hits and seeing where the timing residuals of the PMT hits would be most reduced. After these test vertices have been indentified, a maximum likelihood fit over all the PMT hits in the event is performed, shown in Equation \ref{bonsailikelihood}.

\begin{equation}
    \mathcal{L}(\vec{x}, t_{0})=\sum_{i=1}^{N_{\text {hlt }}} \log (P(t-t_{\text {tof }}-t_{0}))
\label{bonsailikelihood}
\end{equation}

where ($\vec{x}, t_{0}$) is the test vertex, and $(P(t-t_{\text {tof }}-t_{0}))$ is the probablility density function of the timing residual, which for each PMT hit is defined as $(t-t_{\text {tof }}-t_{0})$, where $t_{0}$ is the time of the interaction, $t_{tof}$ is the time of flight from the interaction vertex position to the position of the hit PMT, $t$ is the PMT hit time. The vertex resolution

    \label{bonsaivertexres}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Direction Reconstruction}

Cherenkov light is emitted in a conical formation as electrons and positrons travel through water, with a Cherenkov angle of $\approx 42\degree$. BONSAI can reconstruct the direction of these particles by using this information along with the reconstructed vertex. This reconstruction occurs using a maximum likelihood function defined in Equation \ref{directionlikelihoodeq}.

\begin{equation}
    \mathcal{L}(\vec{d})=\sum_{i}^{N_{20}} \log (f(\cos\theta_{i}, E))\times\frac{\cos\theta_{i}}{a(\theta_{i})}
    \label{directionlikelihoodeq}
\end{equation}

$f(\cos\theta_{i},E)$ is the expected distribution of the angle between the vector of the direction $\vec{d}$ of the particle, and the observed Cherenkov photon from the position of the reconstructed vertex. The reason there is a spread in this energy distribution is because while the highest value of this distribution occurs at the cosine of the opening Cherenkov angle of $42\degree$, due to the particle travelling through the water being Coulomb scattered multiple times, there is a variation in the angle because of the varying particle energy. $N_{20}$ is the number of hits whose residual hit time is within 20ns of the time of the reconstructed event, which is used in order to reduce the amount dark noise and scattered photons contribute to the direction reconstruction calculation. The  variable $a(\theta_{i})$ is used in the second term in Equation \ref{directionlikelihoodeq}, and it is linked to the angle of incidence of the photon on the PMT $a(\theta_{i})$, and is a correction factor stemming from the acceptance of PMTs and therefore linked to the shape of the PMT and it's acrylic case. 


\subsection{Energy reconstruction}

The kinetic energy of a particle is proprtional to the amount of Cherenkov photons emitted from it, and if we assume that the Cherenkov photons in a single event come from a single electron, we can reconstruct the total energy of the electron. Instead of using the number of photoelectrons of all hit photomultiplier tubes to reconstruct the energy of low energy events, the number of hit photomultiplier tubes is used instead. The reasons for this are threefold - firstly, low energy events emit a small number of Cherenkov photons, and therefore average about one photon per hit PMT. Secondly, at single photoelectron level, the resolution of photoelectrons is bad, and third, the number of photoelectrons produced is related to the gain of the photomultiplier tubes, which is given by equation:

\begin{equation}
    G(i) \propto \frac{Q_{o b s}(i)}{N_{o b s}(i)}
\label{gain_equation}
\end{equation}

where $G(i)$ is the gain of each PMT and $Q_{obs}(i)$ is the average charge for each inner detector photomultiplier tube, and $N_{obs}(i)$ is the number of times that photomultiplier tube $i$ registers a charge which is greater than the threshold charge value. Due to the variation in gain value not affecting the number of hit photomultiplier tubes as much as it does for the number of photoelectrons, number of hit PMTs is used instead. Energy reconstruction uses $N_{50}$, which is the number of photomultiplier tube hits in a 50 ns window, which allows for the rejection of dark noise hits for the photomultiplier tubes. The number of effective photomultiplier tubes which are hit, the number of hit PMTs in this timing window of 50ns is summed up, while being weighted with correction factors, shown in Equation \ref{effectivePMTs}. 

\begin{equation}
    N_{e f f}=\sum_{i=1}^{N_{50}}\left[\left(X_{i}-\epsilon_{\text {dark }}+\epsilon_{\text {tail }}\right) \times \frac{N_{\text {all }}}{N_{\text {alive }}} \times \frac{1}{S\left(\theta_{i}, \phi_{i}\right)} \times \exp \left(\frac{r_{i}}{\lambda}\right) \times G(i)\right]
    \label{neff}
\end{equation}

where $X_{i}$ is the correction factor hits with many photoelectrons. This correction factor is important because if some photomultiplier tubes are hit by multiple photons (for example, if the edge of the fiducial volume is where the event vertex took place). The number of photoelectrons produced by each hit photomultiplier tube is estimated using the occupancy of the eight photomultiplier tubes which surround it. Using the number of hit photomultiplier tubes ($n_{i}$) and the number of functional photomultiplier tubes that surround the i-th photomultiplier tube ($N_{i}$), the formula for $X_{i}$ is shown in Equation \ref{correction_factor}.

\begin{equation}
    X_{i}=\left\{\begin{array}{ll}
    \log \left(1-n_{i} / N_{i}\right)^{-N_{i} / n_{i}} & \left(n_{i}<N_{i}\right) \\
    3 & \left(n_{i}=N_{i}\right)
    \end{array}\right.
\end{equation}


$\epsilon_{dark}$ in Equation \ref{neff} is a correction factor for dark noise hits, shown in Equation \ref{edark}, where $R_{dark}$ is the average value for the dark rate during the run period that the event is in and $N_{\text {PMT}\text {alive }}$ is the number of active photomultiplier tubes in the inner detector.


\begin{equation}
    \epsilon_{\text {dark }}=\frac{N_{\text {PMT}\text {alive }} \times R_{\text {dark }} \times 50 \mathrm{~ns}}{N_{50}}
    \label{edark}
\end{equation}

$\epsilon_{tail}$ is the correction factor for photomultiplier tube hits which are in the tail end of the 50ns timing window, and is defined in Equation $\ref{etail}$.

\begin{equation}
    \epsilon_{\text {tail }}=\frac{N_{100}-N_{50}-N_{\text {alive }} \times R_{\text {dark }} \times(100-50) \mathrm{ns}}{N_{50}}
    \label{etail}
\end{equation}


$\frac{1}{S(\theta_{i}, \phi_{i})}$ is the inverse of the effective area of the ith hit photomultiplier tube photocathode, from the direction of the incident photon given by $(\theta_{i}, \phi_{i})$.

$G(i)$ is the gain correction for the quantum efficiency of the photomultiplier tubes and $exp(\frac{r_{s}}{\lambda})$ is the correction for water transparency which accounts for the amount of attenuation undergone by the photons in water, where $\lambda$ is the water transparency measured during the run period which includes the event, and $r_{i}$ is the distance between the reconstructed event vertex and the i-th hit PMT.

The average of each $N_{eff}$ distribution is taken, after producing multiple $N_{eff}$ distributions with fixed energies using Monte Carlo. These energies are fitted with a polynomial which is a function of the averaged $N_{eff}$ distribution, so the reconstructed energy is converted from $N_{eff}$.

\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Neutrino Physics}

There are a plethora of physics phenomenon in which neutrinos are involved, including beta decay, cosmic rays, and supernovae. As part of the Standard Model, they are descibed as being Dirac fermions with no electric charge with three flavours: the electron neutrino, the muon neutrino and the tau neutrino, corresponding with their associated leptons: the electron, muon and tauon. Prior to the discovery of neutrino oscillations, it was believed that neutrinos were massless, but they in fact have small but non zero masses (<1eV). The next subsections of this chapter will discuss a brief history of neutrino physics including the discovery of neutrino oscillations, the manner in which neutrinos interact with nuclei in the Super-Kamiokande detector, and the motivation behind an NCQE neutron tagging analysis.

\subsection{History of Neutrino Physics}

To correct a violation of energy conservation discovered in beta-decay, Wolfgang Pauli put forward the idea of a neutrino (Italian for "little neutral one") as a solution. In 1934, Enrico Fermi's theory of beta decay stated that a neutron could decay to a proton, electron and an antielectron neutrino and in 1956, Clyde Cowan and Frederick Reines directly confirmed the existence of neutrinos, by detetecting the electron antineutrino originating from inverse beta decay produced from a nuclear reactor. In inverse beta decay (shown in Equation \ref{eq:IBD_eq}), an electron antineutrino interacts with a proton to produce a neutron and positrons. These positrons pair-annihilate with electrons and produce two 0.5 MeV gamma rays which go in opposite directions. Scintillator material was placed in a tank of water, which was used to detect the gamma photons, and the scintillator light produced flashes of visible light which were detected by photomultiplier tubes. Cadmium chloride was used to detect the coincident neutron, which after exciting and de-exciting, emits a gamma ray within 5 microseconds after the pair-annihilation gammas are detected. In 1962, Ledermen, Schwartz and Steinberger detecting the muon neutrino, and in 2000 the DONUT collaboration at Fermilab detected the existence of the tau neutrino. 

In the 1960s, the Homestake experiment made the first measurement of solar electron neutrino flux. These are produced by nuclear fusion using the proton-proton chain reaction, where four protons are converted into neutrinos, alpha particles, positrons and energy. The experiment used a perchloroethlene-based detector, placed 1,478 metres underground in the Homestake Gold Mine in South Dakota. When an electron neutrino interacts with 37Cl in the perchloroethlene, the 37Cl becomes a radioactive isotope of 37Ar which are extracted by bubbling helium through the tank, and then counted in order to determine how many neutrinos had been captured. The theoretical solar neutrino flux calculated by John Bachall was about three times as much as Raymond Davis' results from the experiment: with Bachall's calculations predicting a solar neutrino flux of $7.9 \pm 2.6$ SNU, whereas the Homestake experimental results showed a flux of $2.1 \pm 0.3$ SNU. These results were consistent with those from the Kamiokande, SAGE and GALLEX experiments.
\newline
The solution to this problem came from the Super-Kamiokande and Sudbury Neutrino Observatory experiments. In 1998, Super Kamiokande showed evidence of neutrino oscillation: where muon neutrinos produced by cosmic rays in the upper atmosphere changed into tau neutrinos within the Earth, pointing to the fact that the deficit in the solar neutrino flux oberved at Homestake, SAGE and GALLEX had to do with neutrino oscillation. In 2001 SNO observed the flux of electron neutrinos but also the flux of all flavours of neutrinos, and found that the fraction of electron neutrinos was found to be 34\%, perfectly concordant with the prediction.

\subsection{Neutrino Oscillation}
In 1957 Bruno Pontecorvo postulated that neutrinos could transition from neutrinos to antineutrinos and vice versa (similarly to how two kinds of neutral kaons ($\bar{K_{0}}$, and $K_{0}$ were found to oscillate.) Neutrino flavour oscillation theory was then developed by Maki, Nakagawa and Sakata in 1962. The PMNS matrix (Pontecorvo-Maki-Nakagawa-Sakata matrix), the neutrino analogue of the Cabbibo-Kobayashi-Masakawa quark mixing matrix. 
Equation \ref{eq:neutrino_osc} shows the relationship between the mass and flavour eigenstates for a neutrino with a definite flavour of $\alpha$ and a definite mass of $m_{i}$.

$$
\begin{aligned}
&\left|\nu_{\alpha}\right\rangle=\sum_{i} U_{\alpha i}^{*}\left|\nu_{i}\right\rangle \\
&\left|\nu_{i}\right\rangle=\sum_{\alpha} U_{\alpha i}\left|\nu_{\alpha}\right\rangle
\end{aligned}
\label{eq:neutrino_osc}
$$


In Equation \ref{eq:neutrino_osc}, the terms $U_{\alpha i}^{*}$ and $U_{\alpha i}$ are the complex conjugate and normal PMNS matrix. Equation \ref{eq:PMNS_matrix} shows the 3x3 form of the PMNS matrix, where $c_{ij} = cos {\theta_{ij}}$ and $s_{ij} = sin {\theta_{ij}}$.

$$
\begin{aligned}
&U=\left(\begin{array}{ccc}
1 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & c_{23} & s_{23} \\
0 & -s_{23} & c_{23}
\end{array}\right)\left(\begin{array}{ccc}
c_{13} & 0 & s_{13} e^{-i \delta_{\mathrm{CP}}} \\
0 & 1 & 0 \\
-s_{13} e^{i \delta_{\mathrm{CP}}} & 0 & c_{13}
\end{array}\right)\left(\begin{array}{ccc}
c_{12} & s_{12} & 0 \\
-s_{12} & c_{12} & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 1
\end{array}\right)\\
&=\left(\begin{array}{ccc}
c_{12} s_{13} & s_{12} c_{13} & s_{13} e^{-i \delta_{\mathrm{CP}}} \\
-s_{12} c_{23}-c_{12} s_{13} s_{23} e^{i \delta_{\mathrm{CP}}} & c_{12} c_{23}-s_{12} s_{13} s_{23} e^{i \delta_{\mathrm{CP}}} & c_{13} s_{23} \\
s_{12} s_{23}-c_{12} s_{13} c_{23} e^{i \delta_{\mathrm{CP}}} & c_{12} s_{23}-s_{12} s_{13} c_{23} e^{i \delta_{\mathrm{CP}}} & c_{13} c_{23}
\end{array}\right),
\end{aligned}
\label{eq:PMNS_matrix}
$$

In Equation \ref{eq:PMNS_matrix}, if the sin $\delta_{CP}$ terms are not equal to 0, it means that there will be imaginary terms in the matrix, which will contribute to CP (charge-parity) violation. The angles $\theta_{12}$, $\theta_{23}$ and $\theta_{13}$ are mixing angles. An additional 3 x 3 matrix term is present if neutrinos are proven to be their own antiparticle (Majorana particles): it has not been proven whether neutrinos are Majorana or not. Equation \ref{eq:maj_nu} shows this extra term, where the two Majorana CP-violating phases are given as ($\alpha_{21}$, $\alpha_{31}$). 

$$
\left(\begin{array}{ccc}
1 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & e^{i \lambda_{21}} & 0 \\
0 & 0 & e^{i \lambda_{31}}
\end{array}\right)
\label{eq:maj_nu}
$$


\subsection{Neutrino-nucleus interactions in Super-Kamiokande Gd}
Understanding neutrino interaction modes, and understanding neutrino nucleus interaction modes, in particular the neutral current quasielastic reaction is key to understanding this analysis. 

There are two main types of neutrino interaction: charged-current (CC) and neutral current (NC). The former occurs when a W $\pm$ boson is used in a nuclear exchange, and the latter occurs when a $Z^{0}$ is used (see Figure \ref{fig:CC_NC}).

\begin{figure}
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{Figures/CC_NC.png}
    \caption{Feynman diagrams of charged-current (left) and neutral-current (right) neutrino interactions}
    \label{fig:CC_NC}
\end{figure}

There are multiple types of neutrino-nucleus interactions that occur which can be either charged current or neutral current interactions, or both. 

One such interaction, and often the simplest interaction is elastic scattering ($$
\nu+e^{-} \rightarrow \nu+e^{-}
$$), which occurs when a neutrino scatters off an electron with a virtual vector boson being exchanged. This type of scattering is used in the detection of low energy neutrinos, primarily those from the sun. Figure \ref{fig:elastic_scattering} shows the Feynman diagrams for this kind of interaction.

\begin{figure}
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{Figures/elastic_scattering.png}
    \caption{Feynman diagrams of neutral-current (left) and charged-current (right) neutrino-electron scattering}
    \label{fig:elastic_scattering}
\end{figure}

Single mesons can also be produced via neutrino-nucleon reactions: these are mostly pions, but also some kaons and eta particles can also be produced. Here a neutrino with a high enough energy, interacts with and excites a nucleon, producing a resonant baryon which decays to a nucleon and a single pion (shown in Equation \ref{eq:resonant_pion}), where $N$ and $N'$ are nucleons.

$$
\begin{gathered}
\nu_{l}+N \rightarrow l+N^{*} \\
N^{*} \rightarrow \pi+N^{\prime}
\end{gathered}
\label{eq:resonant_pion}
$$

The resonant baryon produced during the reaction is usually a $\Delta(1232)$ resonance. 

Single pion final sates can also be priduced by a neutrino which scatters an entire nucleus (X), shown in Equation \ref{eq:single_pion_CC} for the charged current reactions and Equation \ref{eq:single_pion_NC} for neutral current reactions. 

\begin{equation}
\nu_{l}+X \rightarrow l^{-}+X+\pi^{+}, \quad \bar{\nu}_{l}+X \rightarrow l^{+}+X+\pi^{-}
\label{eq:single_pion_CC}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\nu_{l}+X \rightarrow \nu_{l}+X+\pi^{0}, \quad \bar{\nu}_{l}+X \rightarrow \bar{\nu}_{l}+X+\pi^{0}
\label{eq:single_pion_NC}
\end{equation}

At higher energies (above 1 GeV), neutrino interactions can also produce kaons in the final state, due to the higher energies being able to produce strange quarks. 

Deep inelastic scattering is a type of neutrino interaction where the neutrino scatters off a quark inside the proton or neutron involved in the exchange, via a W (CC) or Z (NC) boson (Equation \ref{eq:DIS_eq}), shown in Figure \ref{fig:CC_DIS}.

$$
\begin{aligned}
&\nu_{l}+N \rightarrow l^{-}+X, \quad \bar{\nu}_{l}+N \rightarrow l^{+}+X(\mathrm{CC}) \\
&\nu_{l}+N \rightarrow \nu_{l}+X, \quad \bar{\nu}_{l}+N \rightarrow \bar{\nu}_{l}+X(\mathrm{NC})
\end{aligned}
\label{eq:DIS_eq}
$$

The next two neutrino-nucleus interactions explained here are of particular relevance to the analysis in this thesis: inverse beta decay (IBD) and quasi-elastic scattering. 

Inverse beta decay is the reaction by which Cowan and Reines first detected electron antineutrinos: it is important at low energies: from the minimum energy for the reaction to take place ($E_{\nu}$ = 1.806 MeV) to tens of MeV. Diffuse Supernova Neutrino Background and low energy antineutrinos produced from nuclear reactors can be detected via this process. Figure \ref{fig:IBD_feynman} shows the Feynman diagram for this reaction. The neutron produced by this reaction is integral to the motivation behind the Gadolinium-doping upgrade to Super-Kamiokande, which will be explained in the next section.

Finally, we get to the type of interaction investigated in this thesis: quasi-elastic scattering. This makes up the majority of the neutrino-nucleus interaction cross-sections at the energy range from 100 MeV to ~2 Gev, and therefore vital for the study of neutrinos from long baseline neutrino experiments and also low energy atmospheric neutrinos. Equation \ref{eq:QE_reaction} shows the equations for both the charge current (CCQE) and neutral current (NCQE) version of this interaction where the incoming neutrino scatters off a nucleon.

$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathrm{CC}: \nu(k)+n(p) & \rightarrow l^{-}\left(k^{\prime}\right)+p\left(p^{\prime}\right) \\
\bar{\nu}(k)+p(p) & \rightarrow l^{+}\left(k^{\prime}\right)+n\left(p^{\prime}\right) \\
\mathrm{NC}: \nu(k)+N(p) & \rightarrow \quad \nu\left(k^{\prime}\right)+N\left(p^{\prime}\right) \\
\bar{\nu}(k)+N(p) & \rightarrow \bar{\nu}\left(k^{\prime}\right)+N\left(p^{\prime}\right)
\end{aligned}
\label{eq:QE_reaction}
$$

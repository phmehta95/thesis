  abstract = {Procedures and results on hardware level detector calibration in Super-Kamiokande (SK) are presented in this paper. In particular, we report improvements made in our calibration methods for the experimental phase IV in which new readout electronics have been operating since 2008. The topics are separated into two parts. The first part describes the determination of constants needed to interpret the digitized output of our electronics so that we can obtain physical numbers such as photon counts and their arrival times for each photomultiplier tube (PMT). In this context, we developed an in-situ procedure to determine high-voltage settings for PMTs in large detectors like SK, as well as a new method for measuring PMT quantum efficiency and gain in such a detector. The second part describes the modeling of the detector in our Monte Carlo simulation, including in particular the optical properties of its water target and their variability over time. Detailed studies on the water quality are also presented. As a result of this work, we achieved a precision sufficient for physics analysis over a wide energy range (from a few MeV to above a TeV). For example, the charge determination was understood at the 1\% level, and the timing resolution was 2.1 nsec at the one-photoelectron charge level and 0.5 nsec at the 100-photoelectron charge level.},

In a comparison with recent T2K data the strength of the 2p2h multinucleon correlations is determined. Linking this to the isospin (T) of the initial nuclear state, it is found that T=0 leads to a significantly better fit of the recent cross sections obtained by T2K, thus achieving consistency of the 2p2h multi-nucleon correlation contributions between electron-nucleus and neutrino-nucleus reactions.},

Inverse beta decay reactions, as well as charged current quasi-elastic (CCQE) scattering of low energy anti-neutrinos (up to a few hundreds of MeV) in SK, produce one positron and one neutron in the final state. Being able to observe the final state neutron in coincidence with the prompt positron would mean that SK could identify these reactions as genuine with very high confidence.},

  abstract = {We extend to 10 GeV results from a microscopic calculation of charged-current neutrino-nucleus reactions that do not produce a pion in the final state. For the class of events coming from neutrino interactions with two nucleons producing two holes (2p2h), limiting the calculation to three-momentum transfers less than 1.2 GeV produces a two dimensional distribution in momentum and energy transfer that is roughly constant as a function of energy. The cross section for 2p2h interactions scales with the number of nucleons for isoscalar nuclei, similar to the quasi-elastic (QE) cross section. When limited to momentum transfers below 1.2 GeV, the cross section is 26\% of the QE cross section at 3 GeV, but 14\% if we neglect a Delta1232 resonance absorption component. The same quantities are 33\% and 17\% for anti-neutrinos. For the quasi-elastic interactions, the full nuclear model with long range correlations produces an even larger, but approximately constant distortion of the shape of the four-momentum transfer at all energies above 2 GeV. The 2p2h enhancement and long-range correlation distortions to the cross section for these interactions is significant enough they should be observable in precision experiments to measure neutrino oscillations and neutrino interactions at these energies, but also balance out and produce less total distortion than each effect does individually.},

The measurement should be performed in EAR-1 with cutting edge C6D6 detectors specifically designed for n\_TOF. Since the cross section of these two isotopes changes by orders of magnitude as a function of neutron energy, two highlyenriched samples for each isotope will be measured: a very thin one for neutron energies up to 100 meV, and a thicker one for neutron energies above 100 meV.},

  abstract = {Supernovae are among the most magnificent events in the observable universe. They produce many of the chemical elements necessary for life to exist and their remnants---neutron stars and black holes---are interesting astrophysical objects in their own right. However, despite millennia of observations and almost a century of astrophysical study, the explosion mechanism of supernovae is not yet well understood. Hyper-Kamiokande is a next-generation neutrino detector that will be able to observe the neutrino flux from the next galactic supernova in unprecedented detail. In this thesis, I investigate how well such an observation would allow us to reconstruct the explosion mechanism. I develop a high-precision supernova event generator and use a detailed detector simulation and event reconstruction to explore Hyper-Kamiokande's response to five supernova models simulated by different groups around the world. I show that 300 neutrino events in Hyper-Kamiokande---corresponding to a supernova at a distance of at least 60 kpc---are sufficient to distinguish between these models with high accuracy. These findings indicate that, once the next galactic supernova happens, Hyper-Kamiokande will be able to determine details of the supernova explosion mechanism.},

  abstract = {On the strength of a double Nobel prize winning experiment (Super)Kamiokande and an extremely successful long baseline neutrino programme, the third generation Water Cherenkov detector, Hyper-Kamiokande, is being developed by an international collaboration as a leading worldwide experiment based in Japan. The Hyper-Kamiokande detector will be hosted in the Tochibora mine, about 295 km away from the J-PARC proton accelerator research complex in Tokai, Japan. The currently existing accelerator will be steadily upgraded to reach a MW beam by the start of the experiment. A suite of near detectors will be vital to constrain the beam for neutrino oscillation measurements. A new cavern will be excavated at the Tochibora mine to host the detector. The experiment will be the largest underground water Cherenkov detector in the world and will be instrumented with new technology photosensors, faster and with higher quantum efficiency than the ones in Super-Kamiokande. The science that will be developed will be able to shape the future theoretical framework and generations of experiments. Hyper-Kamiokande will be able to measure with the highest precision the leptonic CP violation that could explain the baryon asymmetry in the Universe. The experiment also has a demonstrated excellent capability to search for proton decay, providing a significant improvement in discovery sensitivity over current searches for the proton lifetime. The atmospheric neutrinos will allow to determine the neutrino mass ordering and, together with the beam, able to precisely test the three-flavour neutrino oscillation paradigm and search for new phenomena. A strong astrophysical programme will be carried out at the experiment that will detect supernova neutrinos and will measure precisely solar neutrino oscillation.},

  abstract = {Supernova detection is a major objective of the Super-Kamiokande (SK) experiment. In the next stage of SK (SKGd), gadolinium (Gd) sulfate will be added to the detector, which will improve the ability of the detector to identify neutrons. A core-collapse supernova (CCSN) will be preceded by an increasing flux of neutrinos and antineutrinos, from thermal and weak nuclear processes in the star, over a timescale of hours; some of which may be detected at SK-Gd. This could provide an early warning of an imminent CCSN, hours earlier than the detection of the neutrinos from core collapse. Electron antineutrino detection will rely on inverse beta decay events below the usual analysis energy threshold of SK, so Gd loading is vital to reduce backgrounds while maximizing detection efficiency. Assuming normal neutrino mass ordering, more than 200 events could be detected in the final 12ÔÇ†hr before core collapse for a 15‚Äì25 solar mass star at around 200ÔÇ†pc, which is representative of the nearest red supergiant to Earth, Œ±-Ori (Betelgeuse). At a statistical false alarm rate of 1ÔÇ†perÔÇ†century, detection could be up to 10ÔÇ†hr before core collapse, and a pre-supernova star could be detected by SK-Gd up to 600ÔÇ†pc away. A presupernova alert could be provided to the astrophysics community following gadolinium loading.},

  abstract = {Super-Kamiokande is a gigantic and versatile detector able to detect neutrinos with energies between a few MeV and a few hundred GeV. Super-K started data taking on 1st of April in 1996 after 5 years construction period and obtained compelling evidence of atmospheric neutrino oscillations in 1998, shortly after the beginning of the experiment. In 2001 SNO in Canada together with the Super-K data established that solar neutrinos are also oscillating. Following those historical discoveries, numerous intriguing results have been obtained by Super-K, like the discovery of oscillatory behavior, tau appearance in the atmospheric neutrinos, the matter effect of the solar neutrinos through the earth. The Super-K detector has also been used as a far detector of the long baseline neutrino oscillation experiments, K2K and T2K. In this article, we report mostly on the studies of the neutrino oscillations by Super-K in a historical context. The prospects for the future of Super-K are also described.},

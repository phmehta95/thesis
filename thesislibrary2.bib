  abstract = {Used for both proton decay searches and neutrino physics, large water Cherenkov (WC) detectors have been very successful tools in particle physics. They are notable for their large masses and charged particle detection capabilities. While current WC detectors reconstruct charged particle tracks over a wide energy range, they cannot efficiently detect neutrons. Gadolinium (Gd) has the largest thermal neutron capture cross section of all stable nuclei and produces an 8 MeV gamma cascade that can be detected with high efficiency. Because of the many new physics opportunities that neutron tagging with a Gd salt dissolved in water would open up, a large-scale R\&D program called EGADS was established to demonstrate this technique's feasibility. EGADS features all the components of a WC detector, chiefly a 200-ton stainless steel water tank furnished with 240 photo-detectors, DAQ, and a water system that removes all impurities from water while keeping Gd in solution. In this paper we discuss the milestones towards demonstrating the feasibility of this novel technique, and the features of EGADS in detail.},

The measurement should be performed in EAR-1 with cutting edge C6D6 detectors specifically designed for n\_TOF. Since the cross section of these two isotopes changes by orders of magnitude as a function of neutron energy, two highlyenriched samples for each isotope will be measured: a very thin one for neutron energies up to 100 meV, and a thicker one for neutron energies above 100 meV.},

The leading players are heavy leptonic neutrinos, \$\textbackslash nu\_\{\textbackslash mu\}\$ and \$\textbackslash nu\_\{\textbackslash tau\}\$; the former and latter potentially gain the energy up to \$\textbackslash sim 100\$ MeV and \$\textbackslash sim 200\$ MeV, respectively, through the shock acceleration. Demonstrating the neutrino shock acceleration by Monte Carlo neutrino transport, we make a statement that it commonly occurs in the early post bounce phase (\$\textbackslash lesssim 50\$ ms after bounce) for all massive stellar collapse experiencing nuclear bounce and would reoccur in the late phase (\$\textbackslash gtrsim 100\$ ms) for failed CCSNe. This opens up a new possibility to detect high energy neutrinos by terrestrial detectors from Galactic CCSNe; hence, we estimate the event counts for Hyper(Super)-Kamiokande, DUNE, and JUNO. We find that the event count with the energy of \$\textbackslash gtrsim 80\$ MeV is a few orders of magnitude higher than that of the thermal neutrinos regardless of the detectors, and muon production may also happen in these detectors by \$\textbackslash nu\_\{\textbackslash mu\}\$ with the energy of \$\textbackslash gtrsim 100\$ MeV. The neutrino signals provide a precious information on deciphering the inner dynamics of CCSN and placing a constraint on the physics of neutrino oscillation; indeed, the detection of the high energy neutrinos through charged current reaction channels will be a smoking gun evidence of neutrino flavor conversion.},

This ASIC detects PMT signals using individual built-in discriminators and drives output timing signals whose width represents the integrated charge of the PMT signal. Combined with external input circuits composed of passive elements, the QTC provides full analog signal processing for the detector's PMTs, ready for further processing by time-to-digital converters (TDCs). High-rate ({$>$}1MHz) signal processing is achieved by short-charge-conversion-time and baseline-restoration circuits. Wide-range charge measurements are enabled by offering three gain ranges while maintaining a short cycle time. QTC chip test results show good analog performance, with efficient detection for a single photoelectron signal, four orders of magnitude dynamic range (0:3mV \textasciitilde{} 3V; 0:2 \textasciitilde{} 2500 pC), 1\% charge linearity, 0.2 pC charge resolution, and 0.1 ns timing resolution.

In 2001 SNO in Canada together with the Super-K data established that solar neutrinos are also oscillating. Following those historical discoveries, numerous intriguing results have been obtained by Super-K, like the discovery of oscillatory behavior, tau appearance in the atmospheric neutrinos, the matter effect of the solar neutrinos through the earth. The Super-K detector has also been used as a far detector of the long baseline neutrino oscillation experiments, K2K and T2K. In this article, we report mostly on the studies of the neutrino oscillations by Super-K in a historical context. The prospects for the future of Super-K are also described.},

Interactions of the neutrinos are observed at near detectors placed at 280 m from the production target and at the far detector -- Super-Kamiokande (SK) -- located 295 km away. The flux prediction is an essential part of the successful prediction of neutrino interaction rates at the T2K detectors and is an important input to T2K neutrino oscillation and cross section measurements. A FLUKA and GEANT3 based simulation models the physical processes involved in the neutrino production, from the interaction of primary beam protons in the T2K target, to the decay of hadrons and muons that produce neutrinos. The simulation uses proton beam monitor measurements as inputs. The modeling of hadronic interactions is re-weighted using thin target hadron production data, including recent charged pion and kaon measurements from the NA61/SHINE experiment. For the first T2K analyses the uncertainties on the flux prediction are evaluated to be below 15\% near the flux peak. The uncertainty on the ratio of the flux predictions at the far and near detectors is less than 2\% near the flux peak.},

	abstract = {Used for both proton decay searches and neutrino physics, large water Cherenkov (WC) detectors have been very successful tools in particle physics. They are notable for their large masses and charged particle detection capabilities. While current WC detectors reconstruct charged particle tracks over a wide energy range, they cannot efficiently detect neutrons. Gadolinium (Gd) has the largest thermal neutron capture cross section of all stable nuclei and produces an 8 MeV gamma cascade that can be detected with high efficiency. Because of the many new physics opportunities that neutron tagging with a Gd salt dissolved in water would open up, a large-scale R\&D program called EGADS was established to demonstrate this technique’s feasibility. EGADS features all the components of a WC detector, chiefly a 200-ton stainless steel water tank furnished with 240 photo-detectors, DAQ, and a water system that removes all impurities from water while keeping Gd in solution. In this paper we discuss the milestones towards demonstrating the feasibility of this novel technique, and the features of EGADS in detail.},

The main motivation is related to the need of accurate data for applications to nuclear reactors, but new data could also be useful for recent developments in Neutron Capture Therapy, and for new detector concepts in neutrino research. The measurement should be performed in EAR-1 with cutting edge C6D6 detectors speciﬁcally designed for n\_TOF. Since the cross section of these two isotopes changes by orders of magnitude as a function of neutron energy, two highlyenriched samples for each isotope will be measured: a very thin one for neutron energies up to 100 meV, and a thicker one for neutron energies above 100 meV.},

	abstract = {A new application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC), the high-speed charge-to-time converter (QTC) IWATSU CLC101, provides three channels, each consisting of preamplifier, discriminator, low-pass filter, and charge integration circuitry, optimized for the waveform of a photomultiplier tube (PMT). This ASIC detects PMT signals using individual built-in discriminators and drives output timing signals whose width represents the integrated charge of the PMT signal. Combined with external input circuits composed of passive elements, the QTC provides full analog signal processing for the detector's PMTs, ready for further processing by time-to-digital converters (TDCs). High-rate ({\textgreater}1MHz) signal processing is achieved by short-charge-conversion-time and baseline-restoration circuits. Wide-range charge measurements are enabled by offering three gain ranges while maintaining a short cycle time. QTC chip test results show good analog performance, with efficient detection for a single photoelectron signal, four orders of magnitude dynamic range (0:3mV {\textasciitilde} 3V; 0:2 {\textasciitilde} 2500 pC), 1\% charge linearity, 0.2 pC charge resolution, and 0.1 ns timing resolution.

In 2001 SNO in Canada together with the Super-K data established that solar neutrinos are also oscillating. Following those historical discoveries, numerous intriguing results have been obtained by Super-K, like the discovery of oscillatory behavior, tau appearance in the atmospheric neutrinos, the matter effect of the solar neutrinos through the earth. The Super-K detector has also been used as a far detector of the long baseline neutrino oscillation experiments, K2K and T2K.

Interactions of the neutrinos are observed at near detectors placed at 280 m from the production target and at the far detector -- Super-Kamiokande (SK) -- located 295 km away. The flux prediction is an essential part of the successful prediction of neutrino interaction rates at the T2K detectors and is an important input to T2K neutrino oscillation and cross section measurements. A FLUKA and GEANT3 based simulation models the physical processes involved in the neutrino production, from the interaction of primary beam protons in the T2K target, to the decay of hadrons and muons that produce neutrinos. The simulation uses proton beam monitor measurements as inputs. The modeling of hadronic interactions is re-weighted using thin target hadron production data, including recent charged pion and kaon measurements from the NA61/SHINE experiment. For the first T2K analyses the uncertainties on the flux prediction are evaluated to be below 15\% near the flux peak. The uncertainty on the ratio of the flux predictions at the far and near detectors is less than 2\% near the flux peak.},

The leading players are heavy leptonic neutrinos, \${\textbackslash}nu\_\{{\textbackslash}mu\}\$ and \${\textbackslash}nu\_\{{\textbackslash}tau\}\$; the former and latter potentially gain the energy up to \${\textbackslash}sim 100\$ MeV and \${\textbackslash}sim 200\$ MeV, respectively, through the shock acceleration. Demonstrating the neutrino shock acceleration by Monte Carlo neutrino transport, we make a statement that it commonly occurs in the early post bounce phase (\${\textbackslash}lesssim 50\$ ms after bounce) for all massive stellar collapse experiencing nuclear bounce and would reoccur in the late phase (\${\textbackslash}gtrsim 100\$ ms) for failed CCSNe. This opens up a new possibility to detect high energy neutrinos by terrestrial detectors from Galactic CCSNe; hence, we estimate the event counts for Hyper(Super)-Kamiokande, DUNE, and JUNO. We find that the event count with the energy of \${\textbackslash}gtrsim 80\$ MeV is a few orders of magnitude higher than that of the thermal neutrinos regardless of the detectors, and muon production may also happen in these detectors by \${\textbackslash}nu\_\{{\textbackslash}mu\}\$ with the energy of \${\textbackslash}gtrsim 100\$ MeV. The neutrino signals provide a precious information on deciphering the inner dynamics of CCSN and placing a constraint on the physics of neutrino oscillation; indeed, the detection of the high energy neutrinos through charged current reaction channels will be a smoking gun evidence of neutrino flavor conversion.},

The freshly analysed data of the \${\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}rm 155\}\$Gd(n, \${\textbackslash}gamma\$) reaction are used to improve our previously developed model (ANNRI-Gd model) for the \${\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}rm 157\}\$Gd(n, \${\textbackslash}gamma\$) reaction, and its performance confirmed with the independent data from the \${\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}rm nat\}\$Gd(n, \${\textbackslash}gamma\$) reaction. This article completes the development of an efficient Monte Carlo model required to simulate and analyse particle interactions involving the thermal neutron captures on gadolinium in any relevant future experiments.},

	abstract = {Gadolinium-loading of large water Cherenkov detectors is a prime method for the detection of the Diffuse Supernova Neutrino Background (DSNB). While the enhanced neutron tagging capability greatly reduces single-event backgrounds, correlated events mimicking the IBD coincidence signature remain a potentially harmful background. Neutral-Current (NC) interactions of atmospheric neutrinos potentially dominate the DSNB signal especially in the low-energy range of the observation window that reaches from about 12 to 30 MeV. The present paper investigates a novel method for the discrimination of this background. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) offer the possibility for a direct analysis and classification of the PMT hit patterns of the prompt events. Based on the events generated in a simplified SuperKamiokande-like detector setup, we find that a trained CNN can maintain a signal efficiency of 96 \% while reducing the residual NC background to 2 \% of the original rate. Comparing to recent predictions of the DSNB signal and measurements of the NC background levels in Super-Kamiokande, the corresponding signal-to-background ratio is about 4:1, providing excellent conditions for a DSNB discovery.},

We present a new improved calculation of the IBD yields of the standard Huber-Mueller (HM) model and those of the new models. We show that the reactor rates and the fuel evolution data are consistent with the predictions of the Kurchatov Institute (KI) conversion model and with those of the Estienne-Fallot (EF) summation model, leading to a plausible robust demise of the reactor antineutrino anomaly. We show that the results of several goodness of fit tests favor the KI and EF models over other models that we considered. We also discuss the implications of the new reactor flux models for short-baseline neutrino oscillations due to active-sterile mixing. We show that reactor data give upper bounds on active-sterile neutrino mixing that are not very different for the reactor flux models under consideration and are in tension with the large mixing required by the Gallium anomaly that has been refreshed by the recent results of the BEST experiment.},

Most of T2K neutrinos are created through in-flight decays of unstable hadrons, produced by interactions of 31 GeV/c protons in a long graphite target (90 cm). External hadron production data is used for correcting the flux model. The analysis presented here uses a new NA61 dataset, collected in 2009 using the full length replica of the T2K target. The preliminary results suggest a reduction of the hadronic interaction component of the neutrino flux uncertainty by {\textasciitilde}50\%, to errors of less than 5\%.},

All aspects of this detector are reviewed, with particular emphasis on the determination of the extraction and counting efficiencies, the key experimental parameters that are necessary to convert the measured 37Ar count rate to the solar neutrino production rate. A thorough consideration is also given to the systematics of the detector, including the measurement of the extraction and counting efficiencies and the nonsolar production of 37Ar. The combined result of 108 extractions is a solar neutrino-induced 37Ar production rate of 2.56 ± 0.l6 (statistical) ± 0.16 (systematic) SNU.}

While we include the strength information of 15 prominent peaks above 5 MeV and associated peaks below 1.6 MeV from our data directly into the model, we rely on the theoretical inputs of nuclear level density and the photon strength function of \\$\\{\\}^\\{158\\}\\$Gd to describe the continuum \\$\\gamma\\$-ray spectrum from the \\$\\{\\}^\\{157\\}\\$Gd(\\$n\\$,\\$\\gamma\\$) reaction. Our model combines these two components. The results of the comparison between the observed \\$\\gamma\\$-ray spectra from the reaction and the model are reported in detail.}",

This modification will enable it to identify low energy anti-neutrinos for the world’s first observation of the Diffuse Supernova Neutrino Background (DSNB). On average, there is one core-collapse supernova somewhere in the universe each second. The neutrinos emitted from all of these supernovae since the onset of stellar formation have suffused the universe. The flux of the DSNB is expected to be several tens per square centimeter per second. Theoretical models vary, but as many as five diffused supernova neutrinos per year above 10 MeV are expected to interact in SK. However, in order to separate these signals from the much more common solar and atmospheric neutrinos and other backgrounds, we need a new detection method. In 2015, the Super-Kamiokande Collaboration approved the SK-Gd project. It is the upgrade of the SK detector via the addition of water-soluble gadolinium (Gd) salt. Since then, we have been conducting many dedicated studies and developments for deploying Gd to SK.}

abstract = {Neutron-induced gamma simulation has multiple applications in various fields, such as radiation therapy, imaging, and nuclear well logging. Among them, Monte Carlo Codes, MCNP6, and GEANT4 are suitable solutions for nuclear detection. Since there are few published comparisons of GEANT4 with MCNP6, especially for the simulation of neutron-induced gamma spectra, therefore, the aim of this paper is to compare the GEANT4 and MCNP6 in the simulation of low-energy (less than 20 MeV) neutron-induced inelastic and capture gamma spectra, the feasibility of which could help to provide an alternative approach for researchers where MCNP6 is not available. Two representative models pertaining to nuclear well logging applications are designed and employed for the purpose of comparison, based on which neutron-induced inelastic and capture gamma spectra are analyzed using different methods associated with each code specifically, such as Time Window, Energy Cutoff, and Physics Tracking. Based on the cross-section library ENDF/B-VII.1, the results obtained from MCNP 6.1 and GEANT4 10.6 match well, which demonstrates the feasibility of using either code in such applications.}

abstract = {We describe the new ENDF/B-VIII.0 evaluated nuclear reaction data library. ENDF/B-VIII.0 fully incorporates the new IAEA standards, includes improved thermal neutron scattering data and uses new evaluated data from the CIELO project for neutron reactions on 1H, 16O, 56Fe, 235U, 238U and 239Pu described in companion papers in the present issue of Nuclear Data Sheets. The evaluations benefit from recent experimental data obtained in the U.S. and Europe, and improvements in theory and simulation. Notable advances include updated evaluated data for light nuclei, structural materials, actinides, fission energy release, prompt fission neutron and γ-ray spectra, thermal neutron scattering data, and charged-particle reactions. Integral validation testing is shown for a wide range of criticality, reaction rate, and neutron transmission benchmarks. In general, integral validation performance of the library is improved relative to the previous ENDF/B-VII.1 library.}
